We can club various constituents and give them new names. Foe example, a noun phrase consists of a determiner (a, the) followed by a noun. We can go on to define a more complex phrase of the form, "a large cat by the green crate" with the definitions below:

Noun phrase (NP) = determiner (+ adjective) + noun + prepositional phrase (PP)

PP = preposition + NP

Now we have the potential to generate infinitely big sentences using our definitions of phrase structures.
