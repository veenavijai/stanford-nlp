**Lecture 1**

At first glance, human language might seem inefficient compared to increasing bandwidth. However, we can think of it as a way to compress a lot of information. For example, I may speak one sentence which has enough information for you to visualize a whole scene.

A common linguistic way of thinking about meaning is denotational semantics. The 'meaning' is what the word 'represents.'

On a computer, we can use a thesaurus like say, WordNet, which gives us different synonym lists (for different contexts), and also hypernyms (relationships).
